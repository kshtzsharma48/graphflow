# What is this? #
Me playing around with [Spring 3](http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.1.0.M1/spring-framework-reference/html/), [Neo4j's](http://neo4j.org/) graph database and HTML 5 canvas.

# Why? #
I wanted to try out graph databases and Spring 3's REST support to provide a nice web interface to editing a graph structure.

# Disclaimer #
Unlike most of my work there isn't a great deal of tests. The tests included are for experimental discovery purposes. I used maven's [jetty plugin](http://docs.codehaus.org/display/JETTY/Maven+Jetty+Plugin) to drive most of the development.

# Some examples #
